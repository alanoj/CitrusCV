        \multibulletitem Drove enhancements for internal load-testing infrastructure that cut setup times and accelerated release cycles by {\textbf{20\%}}, saving the equivalent of \textbf{1.5 SWE-years} of manual work through early bug and regression detections, preventing scaling test failures and production outages.

        \multibulletitem Bolstered testing coverage by \textbf{40\%} by implementing feature improvements that broadened our load testing platform’s scope by launching new VM controller test grid and control plane emulation logic, adding support for \textbf{1,000+} virtual gateway nodes, and reducing system bottlenecks across releases.

        \multibulletitem Architected scalable control-plane framework logic to enable broader testing coverage by implementing a new test grid with control plane VM emulation logic, enabling support for 1k+ virtual gateway nodes, uncovering critical scalability issues and reducing false-negative test results and system bottlenecks by \textbf{35\%}.

        \multibulletitem Implemented robust solutions to scale load-testing capabilities, successfully introducing higher load VM simulation support, improving overall testing infrastructure efficiency.

        \multibulletitem Enhanced CI release pipeline reliability by proactively detecting and resolving regressions while rapidly addressing blocking failures, resulting in a \textbf{30\%} decrease in release-related outages and significantly shortening developer feedback loops.

        \multibulletitem Streamlined internal control plane test infrastructure, introducing robust support for distributed updates across thousands of VMs. Drove the design and implementation of scalable message distribution logic, significantly reducing simulation flakiness and increasing test accuracy for large-scale deployments.

        \multibulletitem Collaborated on strategic enhancements with cross-functional teams to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks to streamline requirements gathering and align testing strategies with business objectives. Actively engaged in Agile practices including sprint planning and retrospectives, contributing directly to a \textbf{25\%} increase in team productivity and project velocity.

    {Adaptable software engineer with experience at leading technology companies, focused on backend systems, distributed systems, cloud networking, and test automation. At Google, I helped build gRPC/pub-sub based control-plane components and containerized load tests to catch regressions, expose bottlenecks and shorten releases. I am comfortable navigating ambiguity and enjoy tackling ambiguous problems and shipping pragmatic solutions quickly.}

    {%
        \multibulletitem{Owned a gRPC + Pub/Sub load-testing framework (C++/Python) that simulated control-plane behavior at production scale, cutting full regression time by \textsbseries{25\%} and reclaiming \textsbseries{~1.5 SWE-years} annually.}

        \multibulletitem{Architected multicast-controller $\leftrightarrow$ VPC-gateway orchestration to mirror production Pub/Sub traffic between thousands of gateway instances and controllers, improving test fidelity with production; expanded system-level coverage and surfaced throughput bottlenecks later fixed by service owners.}

        \multibulletitem{Maintained and scaled the CI/CD load-testing system: provisioned isolated sandboxes, built automated health/auto-recovery monitoring, and scripted metrics collection while continuously expanding test scenario coverage (failovers, rolling upgrades, burst traffic, resharding) across services/regions to expose critical release-pipeline bottlenecks earlier in CI, accelerating developer feedback by\textsbseries{~40\%} and reducing release-blocking failures by\textsbseries{~30\%}.}

        \multibulletitem{Migrated legacy, OpenFlow-based live VM migration tests to a more scalable Pub/Sub architecture, boosting total throughput by \textsbseries{20\%}, improving resource utilization and reducing test setup/runtimes.}

        \multibulletitem{Drove cross-team code design/reviews and SRE/Dev knowledge shares, which improved on-call triage and accelerated adoption of the test framework across partner teams}

        \multibulletitem{Ramped quickly on Google-internal stack, mapping external paradigms to internal equivalents—Kubernetes $\rightarrow$ Borg, Docker/containers $\rightarrow$ internal sandboxes, gRPC $\rightarrow$ Stubby, SQL $\rightarrow$ Spanner/BigQuery; contributed to a control-plane simulator that replicates large-scale orchestration events, and to CI load tests, catching regressions pre-prod, during onboarding.}

        \multibulletitem{Deployed ~200 test racks (1,000+ devices) and documented host configuration strategies tailored to rack use cases; standardized bring-up and handoff processes that reduced scheduling friction for streamlied lab operations by new techs without escalations.}
        \multibulletitem{Automated provisioning (Python/Bash/Ansible) for firmware flashing and network bootstrap; delivered a repeatable playbook and batch orchestration so racks could be brought online consistently without manual intervention.}
        \multibulletitem{Built Splunk dashboards, alerts, and auto-remediation scripts for device health and job status; reduced MTTD/MTTR by enabling on-call techs to triage from a single pane of glass with documented runbooks}
        \multibulletitem{Defined rack bring-up smoke tests (power, network, device enumeration) and acceptance criteria with SRE/lab ops; ensured racks met production-ready standards before handoff.}
        \multibulletitem{Authored setup docs and remediation runbooks and trained lab techs; improved shift-to-shift continuity and reduced escalations for common failures.}

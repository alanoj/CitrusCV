    {%
        \multibulletitem{Drove development of internal Python/C++ load-testing framework, implementing gRPC, protobuff and pub/sub based workflows and components to replicate networking control-plane behavior—reducing test runtimes by \textbf{25\%} and saving \textbf{1.5 SWE-years} via regression detection.}

        \multibulletitem{Spearheaded the design and developement of a VPC gateway and multicast VM controller feature into the framework—extending C++ control-plane emulation and authoring Python orchestration scripts—to replicate the production pub/sub communication between 1k+ VPC gateway components to each multicast VM controller, expanding the scope testing, uncovering critical scalability issues and reducing system bottlenecks by \textbf{35\%}.}

        \multibulletitem{Automated and maintained critical CI/CD pipeline load-test tasks by provisioning isolated test sandbox containers, creating CRON test monitoring jobs, and scripting metric collection tasks with python and SQL—to reduce release-blocking failures by 30\% and accelerate developer feedback loops by \textbf{40\%}.}

        \multibulletitem{Enhanced the control-plane testing by migrating legacy host VM live migration system to a more scalable pub/sub architecture, boosting system throughput by \textbf{20\%} and improving test accuracy (reducing false negatives) by \textbf{35\%}.}

        \multibulletitem{Collaborated with SRE and partner dev's to drive design reviews, brown-bag knowledge-sharing sessions, sprint planning/retrospectives and conducting peer code reviews of Python, C/C++ to improve code quality and team alignment, ensuring over \textbf{98\%} uptime for critical test grids.}

        \multibulletitem{}Led a team to design, wire, and deploy 200+ test racks housing 1,000+ devices; defined host configuration strategies for each rack’s unique use case, driving a \textbf{50\%} increase in availability, \textbf{30\%} reduction in test scheduling wait times, and \textbf{20\%} boost in overall lab uptime.
        \multibulletitem{Automated device provisioning and network setup with Python, Bash, and Ansible scripts—flashing firmware at scale and orchestrating batch configurations—to reduce manual setup time by and sustain \textbf{97\%} lab uptime.}
        \multibulletitem{Developed custom Splunk monitoring and remediation tools, integrating gathered metrics into dashboards and internal alerting systems, enabling real-time detection and auto-recovery of host and device failures, which cut device downtime by \textbf{27\%} and improved test success rates by \textbf{34\%}.}
